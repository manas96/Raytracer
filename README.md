# Raytracer

A raytracer I wrote for learning. Note that is purely CPU and I have not attempted to optimize this in any way, as that was not my goal. Used VS2019 to compile. 

Output is generated in the form of a PPM file with various attributes in the file name.





Implemented from the theory I studied in Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing booklet.
