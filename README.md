# Raytracer

A (backwards) raytracer I wrote for learning. Note that is purely CPU and I have not attempted to optimize this in any way, as that was not my goal. Used VS2019 to compile. 

Using GLM for vector math.

Implemented from the theory I studied in Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing booklet.
## TODO : 
- [X] Implement Bounding volume hierarchies.
- [ ] Parallelize.
- [ ] Study [PBRT's](https://www.pbrt.org/) architecture.
- [ ] Study/contribute to the Mitsuba renderer.

### Example output : diffuse, dielectric and metallic materials with triangle primitives
